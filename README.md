### Hello there!

This is the place where I save some of my most fun projects. You're welcome to look around! But be warned, I am no coding wizard (yet) and even though I like clean and understandable code, those projects are part of my learning journey and therefore not beautified, polished or regularly checked. Take it as an inspiration ;)
