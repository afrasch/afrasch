### Hello there!

This is the place where I save some of my most fun projects from the Core Curriculum at 42 Coding School. You're welcome to look around! But be warned - even though I like clean and efficient code, those projects are part of my learning journey and therefore not polished, beautified or regularly checked. Take it as an inspiration ;)

Not included team projects:
webserv - an HTTP webserver written in C++.
ft_transcendence - a full-stack project where the user can sign up to play Pong, make friends and mute them in their private chat room. Built with TypeScript, Vue and postgres.
